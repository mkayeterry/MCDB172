    "### **Abstract**\n",
    "This study utilizes a dynamical model of the human immune response to influenza A virus infection developed by *Hancioglu et al.* to investigate how variation in immune response affects disease severity. The study aims to determine the level of cellular resistance at which disease becomes asymptomatic by systematically varying the level of resistant cells and analyzing the resulting disease outcomes using Python simulations. The goal of the study is to provide insight into the immune mechanisms that underlie disease progression and identify potential targets for intervention, particularly in the design and implementation of effective vaccination strategies. By exploring the complex dynamics of the host-pathogen interaction, this approach can be applied to a range of infectious diseases, offering a powerful tool for understanding disease transmission and control. <br />\n",

    "### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Influenza A virus&mdash;of the family *Orthomyxoviridae*&mdash;continues to present a substantial threat to public health, causing seasonal epidemics that result in over 650,000 deaths per year (Lee & Ryu, 2021). Influenza A virus (IAV) is a single stranded, negative sense RNA virus&mdash;class V of the Baltimore classification system. IAV is of particular interest, as it is known to undergo antigenic shifts and drifts, where its surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin, and neuraminidase undergo periodic mutations (Moghadami, 2016). This constant antigenic evolution is due to the segmented nature of its genome, which makes it highly susceptible to genetic reassortment and allows the virus to evade host immune responses. Such genetic reassortment additionally enables animal and human strains to converge and circulate, resulting in intermittent pandemics causing disruption at a global level (Hancioglu et al., 2007). The significant variation in IAV strains from one season to another has made it difficult to develop effective strategies for prevention and control. To address this issue, it is essential to understand the complex dynamics between the virus and the human immune response.\n",
    ">\n",
    "In recent years, mathematical models have become indispensable in studying the dynamics of disease transmission at both the cellular and population levels. At the cellular level, such models allow for the prediction of disease severity and the efficacy of interventions. Among these models, dynamical systems provide a means of investigating the complex mechanisms that underpin biological function. That is, in capturing the temporal changes in the cellullar immune response, these models offer insight into the potential impact of intervention&mdash;facilitating development of strategies for disease control and damage reduction. This study utilizes a system of ordinary differential equations which together model the human immune response to IAV infection. In reproducing and expanding upon a model by *Hancioglu et al.*, this study attempts to elucidate the factors most important in disease reduction. The immune response to viral infection is complex, and it is important to note that the modulation of resistant cells presented here do not wholly encompass the complexity of the human immune system and may not reflect the full range of immunological responses. Nonetheless, the model provides a useful framework for exploring how variation in immune response affects disease outcomes and identifying potential targets for intervention. Further experimentation presented in this study aims to shift focus to effectiveness of intervention, and thresholds necessary for reduced expression of disease. \n",

    "*2.1 Dynamical Model and Variables*\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulations presented in this paper utilize a system of 10 ordinary differential equations from *Hancioglu et al.*, which represents the adaptive and innate immune response to infection via the influenza A virus (IAV). The intent of the model presented in this paper is to simulate a system that has had exposure to a similar IAV strain through vaccination, prior to infection. In order to do so, the model was first run under standard conditions (e.g. a healthy, unvaccinated host that has not been exposed to IAV on day zero) to ensure that the system of equations accurately reflects the course of infection.\n",

    "In the following system, $V$ corresponds to the overall concentration of the virus per epithelial cell, and under standard conditions is assumed to be 0.01. Variable $H$ serves to indicate the proportion of healthy cells in the system, and has an initial value of 1 (e.g. 100% of cells are healthy). Healthy cells are defined here as cells that are neither infected nor resistant to the virus. Conversely, infected cells $I$ are those that have been exposed to the virus, and therefore have an initial value of zero. $M$, $F$, and $R$ represent cells that have some immunological response to viral exposure, and are therefore also set to zero under standard conditions. Immunological systems in place prior to viral exposure are represented by $E$, $P$, and $A$, with initial values of 1 under standard conditions. Antigenic distance, represented by $S$, is predicted to be 0.1 under standard conditions, assuming exposure to previous IAV strains. Of particular interest in this experiment are variables $H$, $M$, $F$, and $R$, as modulations of these variables away from standard conditions allow for the simulation of infection in a host that has been vaccinated. The system of equations is formulated as follows, and represents the rate of change per variable during viral infection:\n",

    "### **Discussion**\n",
    "The results of this study offer valuable insights into the progression of influenza A infection (IAV) and the impact of various factors on disease severity, and enables the identification of critical conditions for vaccination efficacy. The computational model presented by *Hancioglu et al.* was successfully implemented, and the simulation accurately captured the expected course of IAV infection under standard conditions, as demonstrated in Figure 1. The fifth day of infection represented the peak of both viral load and cellular damage under standard conditions, setting a baseline for the simulation of vaccination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 serves as further confirmation of the model's implementation. The recreation of findings suggests that viral load per epithelial cell is a critical factor in determining the severity of cellular damage during IAV infection. The results demonstrate that cellular damage increases significantly with increased viral load, with damage peaked at 40% under standard conditions. The model was robust to variations in initial conditions, as cellular damage remained at 40% even with initial viral loads less than the maximum. The earlier onset of cellular damage with greater viral load confirms the intuitive understanding of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of antigenic distance on disease progression was investigated in Figure 3, serving as the introduction to the impact of vaccination. Antigenic distance represents the affinity between the antibodies and the viral strain, with a value of 1 indicating the highest affinity. The results indicate that an absent antigenic distance (e.g. no recognition for the virus) increases cellular damage. However, for initial antigenic distances greater than zero, the higher the antigenic distance, the later the onset of cellular damage. The disease becomes asymptomatic at an antigenic distance of 0.2, suggesting the importance of the affinity of antibodies for the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4 investigated the impact of varying levels of healthy and resistant initial cell types, simulating conditions of vaccination. The inverse proportionality between healthy and resistant cells was implemented, as the higher the initial value for healthy cells, the lower the initial value for resistant cells, and vice versa. The results suggest that a cellular resistance of 50% allows for asymptomatic disease expression, and resistance to the virus delays the onset of viral load.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings begin to investigate implications for the development of effective treatment and intervention measures for IAV infection. The results suggest that reducing the viral load per epithelial cell and increasing the affinity of antibodies for the virus can effectively reduce cellular damage and delay the onset of the disease. More importantly, the results also suggest that increasing the proportion of resistant cells can lead to asymptomatic disease expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of this study is the lack of variation of parameters. The assumption was made that manipulating initial values will have no impact on inherent disease mechanism rates, which will limit its generalizability to real-world situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future directions for this research could include investigating the impact of other factors, such as the impact of both antigenic distance and cellular resistance to innate defense mechanisms. Further modifications should be made to the model to improve its accuracy and robustness to variations in initial conditions. In addition, the validation of the model using real-world data could strengthen the reliability of the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the results of this study provide valuable insights into the factors that influence the severity and progression of IAV infection. The findings provide direction for the development of effective treatment and intervention measures for IAV infection and further investigation could yield executable results.\n"
